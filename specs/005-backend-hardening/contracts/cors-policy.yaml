# Documents the restricted CORS configuration

# Before (current):

  allow_origins: "${CORS_ORIGINS}"  # Unchanged — already configurable via env
  allow_credentials: true            # Unchanged — needed for JWT in cookies/headers
  allow_methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
    - OPTIONS
  allow_headers:
    - Authorization
